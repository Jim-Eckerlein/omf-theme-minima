# Minima

**Minima**, a minimal theme for [Oh my Fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish), the framework for the [Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com).

- **Prompt:** Red when last exit code is non-zero
- **Path:** Relative to home or relative to repository root
- Current Git branch

Due to keeping process executings at a minimim, the prompt is very responsive.
